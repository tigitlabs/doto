# doto

Dotfiles management with Python and Ansible
This tool aims to be `poetry` for `Ubuntu`.
It helps maintaing a manifest file that keeps track of the packages and other setting to apply to a system.

Similar to `poetry` you can run `doto add [package]` which will add the package to the manifest file and install it.

The backend for the first version will be `Ansible` but with an abstaraction layer to be able to replace it in the future.

## Features

- Manage packages from different sources
- Manage hosts
  - This allows you to add package to a specific host. For example if you have a workstation and a laptop you might want to apply different settings and packages.
- Add comments to package entries in the Manifest file.
- CLI to manage and view manifest file.
- Sync the manifest to a remote repository via `Git`
- Besides packages one can also choose to add and apply an `Ansible Role` which is maintained and tested in a separate repository.

- Testing and Dry run. By using the test tools available for `Ansible` one can add a package in a dry-run and create a VM to apply the new manifest to verify that the outcome is a expected.
Command could be `doto deploy host`

Future:
- The tool manages a local manifest file on each host to avoid to keep track of packages that are already installed.

  - Create PR:
    - <https://github.com/ansible/molecule/discussions/3914>
    - geerlingguy ansible playbook testing
  - Have a dir with shared molecule files like prepare.yml
